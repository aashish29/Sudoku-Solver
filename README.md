# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

It is a python based sudoku solver which uses backtracking technique to solve sudoku. If more than 1 answer are possible then any possiblity would be shown. GUI for the same is developed usin tkinter.
